Rolling ball mini game

Hello everyone, it has been a while since I have added things here in my github. Having recently finished all my final exams for the semester, I have decided to learn how to create a game with Unity and test my scripting skills in C#.

Here you can find the Camera Controller, Player Controller, (Object) Rotation scripts.

Happy Making everyone!
