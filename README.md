Rolling ball mini game

Hello everyone, it has been a while since I have added things here in my github. Having recently finished all my final exams for the semester. I have decided to learn how to create a game with Unity and test my scripting skills in C#.

Following are the scripts that I have used for the mini game I have made.

More details on the project has been posted to my online portfolio: https://preciousgracebrazil.wordpress.com/portfolio/rollie-ballie/
